        <p>Hello Friends,</p>
        <p>
          I learned something about the seasons of the year today - Winter to be specific. It happens that I have to
          give an introduction speech at my toastmaster (public speaking club) tomorrow and I have to speak about the
          meeting theme - which is "Winter". To be honest, I have no idea what to talk about. All I know was it's one of
          the seasons and it's my least favorite. Nonetheless, I have to come up with something good and inspirational
          about Winter and while I was thinking what to talk about, one question comes to my mind - why do we even have
          Winter? It is so cold and makes my skin very very dry and irritated as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, I shifted my focus from "why winter is the best season of the year" to "why does Earth have seasons?".
          Growing up and coming from a tropical country, I didn't really get to experience cold weather, hence, I didn't
          understand what winter was and how it happens. The reason why we have winter or different seasons of the year
          is because our earth spins and it spins 360 degree every day. I didn't know that! On top of spinning, our
          Earth also moves around the Sun. It takes 365 days to move around the sun - that's how we get 365 days in a
          year! At this point, I've started to sound either like a 6 years old kid learning Geography for the first time
          or like a full-grown adult who skipped all of his Geography classes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the Earth is moving and spinning, it's not really the reason why we have different seasons. The main
          reason being the Earth is tilted a little bit - 23.44 degrees to be precise. This tilted angle plays a large
          role in the formation of weather, causing different latitudes to directly face the Sun as the Earth moves
          through its orbit. That's why when it's winter in Northern Hemisphere, it's Summer in the Southern Hemisphere,
          and vice versa. Now, the Southern Hemisphere, which I am in, is tilted away from the Sun. Thus, we are having
          this season called "Winter".
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are a parent or future-to-be parent, when your kid asks you one of the stupid questions like - "why do
          we have Summer or Winter". I hope you can give a good answer - our Earth is tilted!
        </p>
        <p>
          Have a great day/ night! <br />
