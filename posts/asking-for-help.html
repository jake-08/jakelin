        <p>Hello Friends,</p>
        <p>
          One of the life-changing lessons I want to share today is - why you should always ask for help. Most people,
          including myself, like to solve problems on their own and can't be bothered to ask for help. In short, asking
          for help is and has always been hard for us. Today, I would like to change this mindset.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few weeks ago, I found out that there is an unnecessary pain that you have to go through when you didn't ask
          for help. No matter what you're struggling with, there's always someone you know or you know of that's
          brilliant at it. So, the trick here is to ask "Who" not "How". Being a massive "How" person, the switch to
          "Why" is quite hard. I know I can figure things out on my own. Given enough time, I'll probably understand or
          find out what I'm looking for. Although it is true, that's not my point.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me give you my own example, a few weeks ago when I was buying a new monitor, I couldn't able to decide
          between two monitors - a 4K one and a 2K one as they were the same price. Obviously, I would like to have a 4K
          monitor but the thing was I didn't know if my 5-year-old laptop can support it. To add extra pressure, the
          sale was going to end in 4 hours!
        </p>
        <p>
          Buying monitors for the first time in my life, I didn't know much about them. When I started my research, it
          even got more complicated because there were so many things to consider before you buy a monitor- different
          cables and ports (HDMI, VGA, Display Port, Mini Display Port, USB-c), different versions of these ports
          support different resolutions, laptops have ports, and port versions, graphic card compatibility and etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          After watching and reading countless youtube videos and articles, I still couldn't answer the question - Does
          my laptop support a 4K monitor? I gave up and called my friend who I know is pretty good with computers and
          ask for help. We literally talked for 2 mins and I've got the answer which is, yes, my laptop supports a 4K
          monitor. Horray! Without further overdue, I ordered a 4K one and it was one of the best purchases I've ever
          made.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, the lesson learned here is don't go through the unnecessary pain like I've gone through. If you know
          someone that could be of help, you simply just ask that person. However, with that being said, learning
          yourself and going through this hectic process definitely has its own benefits. You got to learn new things on
          your own and enjoyed the pleasure of accomplishment especially after struggling in the beginning. After all,
          life is all about learning new skills in multiple areas.
        </p>
