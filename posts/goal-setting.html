            <p>Hello Friends,</p>
            <p>
              I need to get my life in order. I am not gonna lie - I do this all the time but this time, I've got to be serious. I mean a lot more serious than before, you will find out why below. I
              definitely feel better and happier when I have a plan or goals to follow. And that's what I'm going to be doing today - setting goals for this winter.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lesson learned from my past experience, I tend to procrastinate by telling myself that "oh, I will do it next week because I'll be a bit freer", "oh, I will do it after exams" or "after
              work", which, of course, delayed or missed the goals I set for myself. Now, it's clear to me that work is never going to end and I really need to restructure my life and hit all of my
              goals before it's Spring again. <br />
              <br />So, here's my self-inspired but totally insane plan for this winter:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>Finish off my current goals - There are four main goals I set for myself to do a few weeks ago in this short university break.</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      The first goal is to apply for my student visa extension because I took a study break back in 2020. I've already in contact with my agent and she is already helping me with the
                      process.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>The second goal is to get an Australian Driving Licence. For that, I've already booked myself for the driving test in the following week. So, Good Luck Jake.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li><p>The third one to create this personal website. I think I can tick this one off already!</p></li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      The last one is to get a Blood Test to check for any allergies I might have because this winter is really messing up my skin. I had a Blood Test this morning so I will find out
                      soon.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Create a workflow or timetable to juggle between three jobs -</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Some of you might not know that I'm working at Subway to support myself and I've been working there since I came here. I am currently working three days a week and I plan to
                      continue working like this as long as I can.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>At the same time, my university, which I consider as a job, is starting in 2-week time which means I'm going to have a new timetable that I need to adjust.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>The last job is something that I've started recently, I'm working as a support analysis intern at a company in the city. I am also devoting three days of my time there.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      So, in conclusion, I have to create a workflow that can sustain 3 days of Subway work, 3 days of Company work, and 3 or 4 days of University work. And I only have 7 days in a
                      week!
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  My new role at toastmaster - A few months ago, I signed up for a role called "Sergeant-at-arms" at my toastmaster meeting. To my surprise, I've got it and I am honored to get this
                  opportunity. I started this role last week and my job to call the meeting to order and say a few words and formally start the meeting. This would give me an opportunity to speak
                  every week and definitely going to push me to another level. Being part of the executive team, I have to involve in club meetings, club leadership training and etc. This is a
                  mini-commitment I made and my goal is to execute this role to the best of my ability.

                  Writing blogs for my website - Talking about commitment, this website is also my personal commitment I made to myself literally last week. Let's not forget that I also have to do my
                  own maintenance (coding) for my website, on top of writing and pushing out the content. This honestly takes so much time and energy, nonetheless, these blogs I am writing are my
                  babiesss. I really enjoyed writing them SO much that I don't struggle with them, but I wish I could be a better writer. I initially plan to write at least one blog per week but now
                  I'm in uni break and lockdown, why not write three a week. I'm super duper excited about this and I can't wait to share all the content I've planned out for you all.

                  Website Upgrade - There is always room for improvement so is my website. At the moment, my website is a static website which means I've to do a lot of copy-paste. In the future, I
                  would like to have a dynamic website where I basically don't have to do a lot of manual work. But to do that, I need to study new programming languages and frameworks which I can't
                  wait to get started as well.

                  Photography - My last goal is my new found passion which is to learn how to take decent, beginner photos (of myself). I think it's one of those skills that is essential in this 21st
                  century. I don't have the intention to buy a proper camera yet but I'm thinking to buy a new phone which can do the job. I'm not sure what to go for iPhone or Samsung. Please let me
                  know which one you think is better for photography.
