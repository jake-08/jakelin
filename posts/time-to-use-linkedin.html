              <p>Hello Friends,</p>
              <p>
                I was not a Linkedin user, I use Facebook as my main social media platform, and I use Instagram and Twitter occasionally. Even though I had a Linkedin Account opened for many years,
                I've never actually used it. Here are my reasons:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li><p>Linkedin is a social media platform for professionals.<i class="highlight">And I was not.</i></p></li>
                <li><p>On Linkedin, people post about their achievements and their new roles. <i class="highlight">I didn't have any of them and let's be honest, what are my lifetime achievements?</i></p></li>
                <li><p>I still remember vividly that when I first created the account on the 2nd of Feb 2018, my news feed was filled with people who have proper jobs and impressive job titles. <i class="highlight">For someone like me, who had no experience, or a job, or connections, I didn't even know where to begin and I was lost in this professional platform.</i></p></li>
              </ol>
              <p>But things have changed, things are getting better for me (I hope) and I woke up one day, saying to myself that I wanted to be part of this community - this professional community, and experience the whole thing. It is now or never and the time has come for me to be part of this.</p>
              <ol>
                <li><p>I wanted to see the Job Market.🧑‍💼</p></li>
                <li><p>I wanted to sell myself.💰</p></li>
                <li><p>I wanted to show what I am capable of.💪</p></li>
                <li><p>I wanted to make more connections and friends.🏢</p></li>
                <li><p>I wanted to understand how things work around the world, especially in Australia.🌏</p></li>
                <li><p>I wanted to understand the Australian Economy and, perhaps, the Global as well.📈</p></li>
              </ol>
              <p>So, I would like to humbly request all my Linkedin friends and connections, who have achieved something in their life, to help me grow and also bring me along on this journey that I am still figuring out. And I promise I would do the same for those in need if I ever make it.🙂</p>
              <p>Thank you so much if you reached this far!</p>
              <p>
                Much Love, <br />
                Jake
