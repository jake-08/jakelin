        <h3>Welcome to my First Blog</h3>
        <p>
          Welcome to my very first blog. I've been waiting for this moment for the longest time and I'm glad that I'm
          finally doing it. Having only one more semester to finish my master's degree, I would like to document my student/
          living-abroad life in Australia. It's like now or never.
        </p>
        <p>
          To those who have already known me, my friends, families, and relatives, I do want to say that I really miss all
          of you and everyone is in my thoughts and prayers every day. Giving the current situation in Burma, I can feel
          all of the frustration, hardship, depression, and struggle that you all are going through right now and I wanna
          help in all the ways I can. And for those who don't know me or have the slightest idea of who I am, we can take
          it from here. That's fine.
        </p>
