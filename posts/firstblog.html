        <p>Hello Friends,</p>
        <p>
          Welcome to my very first blog. I've been waiting for this moment for the longest time and I'm glad that I'm
          finally doing it. Having only one more semester to finish my master's degree, I would like to document my
          student/ living-abroad life in Australia. It's like now or never.
        </p>
        <p>
          To those who have already known me, my friends, families, and relatives, I do want to say that I really miss
          all of you and everyone is always in my thoughts and prayers. Given the current situation in Burma, I can feel
          and understand all of the frustration, hardship, depression, and struggle that you all are going through right
          now and I wanna help in any way I can. And for those who don't know me or have the slightest idea of who I am,
          we can take it from here. That's fine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before you wander all over my website and thinking that none of the links are working, yes, nothing is working
          (yet). I literally hosted it yesterday and I am still working on it. For the time being, this will be the only
          link that works. And before anyone judges me ^_^ on using other's people templates, yes, I admit that I didn't
          design this website - I got it from the internet but I am going to slowly change it to the way I like. That's
          all for today. I will see you in the next one.
        </p>
        <p>Have a great day/ night!</p>
        <p>Peace, <br />Jake</p>
